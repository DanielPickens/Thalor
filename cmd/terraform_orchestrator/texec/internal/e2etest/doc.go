// Package e2etest contains end-to-end acceptance tests for the texec
// package. It aims to cover as many realistic use cases for texec as possible;
// to serve as a smoke test for the incidental usage of hc-install with texec;
// and, eventually, to define the known and expected behaviour of the entire
// Terraform CLI.
// Test files inside the texec package are intended as unit tests covering the
// behaviour of *Cmd functions.
